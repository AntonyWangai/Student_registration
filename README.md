# Student_registration
This is a student registration system coded in java. 
1.	The main method where execution will begin.
2.	A method that gets the users name and registration number.
3.	A method that gets the users fees paid and calculates the balance remaining automatically. The full fees can be directly instantiated in the code (hard coded). The user should only key in the fee he or she has paid and the program should generate the fee balance.
4.	A method to get the KCPE marks of each subject of the student from the user input. Each mark should be out of a hundred. These marks should be automatically graded by the program once user inputs the marks.
